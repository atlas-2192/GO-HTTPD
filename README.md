======

go-httpd is a example Go project, showing you how to organise that most important of systems -- a HTTP server that allows you to set and get key values in a store. It exhibits many other important principles of a good Go project.

## Running go-httpd
Starting and running go-httpd is easy. Download and build it like so:

```
mkdir go-httpd # Or any directory of your choice
cd go-httpd/
export GOPATH=$PWD
go get github.com/otoolep/go-httpd
```

Run it like so:

```
$GOPATH/bin/go-httpd
```

You can now set a key and read its value back:

```
curl -XPOST localhost:8080/key -d '{"user1": "batman"}'
curl -XGET localhost:8080/key/user1
```

## Use the standard library
Go comes with a high-quality standard library, with support for much important functionality such as networking, compression, JSON serialization, encryption, IO, concurrency, and synchronization. It is better to use the the standard library and have to write a little bit extra code, than to import a third-party library. BLOG LINK

You can this principle at work in go-httpd. It uses the standard _logging_ package, _testing_ package, and does its own HTTP routing.

## Testing
Each package is tested via the framework that comes with the standard library, using straightforward test cases.

### Interfaces
Interfaces are a key concept within Go. They allow many packages to interfact seamlessly. The _io.Reader_ and _io.Writer_ interfaces are the most important examples in the standard library.

Interfaces are also very useful for testing. The HTTP service within go-httpd does not import the Store directly, but instead specifies the interface a Store must support. This makes it very easy to pass a mock store to the HTTP service, as part of its testing.

## Documentation
The _GoDoc_ standard is very easy to follow and results in nice, easy to read, documentation. go-httpd is documented in the GoDoc style. The GoDoc link at the top of this file is automatically generated from the comments in the source.
